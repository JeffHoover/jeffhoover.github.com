<p><strong>Refactor your Software Career</strong></p>

"Selling yourself" is hard work.  Do you send out resumes and get no response back? Or do you land interviews at companies you like but don't get offers?

Maybe you:

- wish companies would come looking for you?

- feel like you could contribute so much more, if you were just at the right company?

- find yourself a little jealous of people who seem to effortlessly land new, exciting jobs?

In this talk, Jeff Hoover will recount his nearly three-year journey out of a stagnating career and into a position as craftsperson /coach in a growing agile consulting firm. You will learn specific techniques to build networks, obtain new skills, gain needed experience, raise your profile, and ultimately land a job you're truly excited about.

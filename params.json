Do you send out resumes and get no response back? Or do you land interviews at companies you like but don't get offers?\r\n\r\n    Maybe you:\r\n\r\n    - wish companies would come looking for you?\r\n\r\n    - feel like you could contribute so much more, if you were just at the right company?\r\n\r\n    - find yourself a little jealous of people who seem to effortlessly land new, exciting jobs?\r\n\r\n    In this talk, Jeff Hoover will recount his nearly three-year journey out of a stagnating career and into a position as craftsperson /coach in a growing agile consulting firm. You will learn specific techniques to build networks, obtain new skills, gain needed experience, raise your profile, and ultimately land a job you're truly excited about.\r\n\r\n**Bio:**\r\n\r\n    Jeff is a software craftsperson and coach for Pillar. His work is focused on the interface between engineering practices and sometimes-overlooked \"soft skills\". His passions for helping others and developing talent have been demonstrated as a contributor to AgileSkillsProject.org, a facilitator for several Day in the Life of Agile classes for Pillar, co-facilitation of a CodeRetreat, and participation in several weekends of \"Coding in the Clink\" at Marion Correctional Institute in Ohio.
